# PathFX

## High level description
PathFX is an interaction-network tool to search for the most relevant protein-protein interactions around a drug's target(s), and then analyzes for which phenotypes the network is enriched relative to the entire interaction network. The algorithm provides tabular results of associated phenotypes, a network file, and sources for phenotypic associations. Running the algorithm with phenotype clustering will produce a further summary file of associated phenotypes, grouped by semantic similarity using UMLS, and a clustergram figure showing associations between these clusters.
